This repository hosts all of the code used for my personal website, which can be found at [simpson.codes](https://simpson.codes).

## Why a portfolio?
I decided to develop my own portfolio to show off the projects I have made throughout my career as a web developer. Many of my projects have been hidden behind a login so previously I had no way of showing these sites to recruiters or application reviewers for job postings. This website was designed to appeal to these users directly, as the home screen serves as a way for the users to get to know me in 30 seconds, similar to a resume, while the rest of the site is available for those who have more time for review. 

## What is on the site?
The site is currently a Github Pages project consisting of four main static HTML pages. These pages are as follows:

* [Home (Index)](https://simpson.codes) - designed for the 30 second visit. Contains a brief introduction about me, some of my most recent work, and a contact form.
* [Resume](https://simpson.codes/resume) - hosts all of my work experience and some of what I feel is my most important skills pertaining to web development.
* [Projects](https://simpson.codes/projects) - gives more details on the projects listed on the home page as well as displays the other projects I have completed.
* [Contact](https://simpson.codes/contact) - a dedicated page for the contact form found on the home page. Because this is a static site, I had to post this form using the Google API and all responses are saved in Google Drive. More info about this can be found [here](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-to-send-email-via-google-script-html-no-server).

## Future Plans
At some point I plan on adding an About page to the site which would contain more personal information about myself. I initially intended on adding it to the first version of the site but have since decided to push it to later due to the school semester starting up. I also plan on redesigning the site without the use of Bootstrap once I start working on version 2 to really challenge myself more as a developer.
