                                <p>
                                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis website is my own
                                    personal portfolio consisting of four main pages designed to
                                    illustrate who I am and what I have accomplished throughout my
                                    career in web development.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy goal for creating this site was to
                                    place myself into the role of my targeted user (a recruiter or
                                    reviewer) and design a site to fit their needs. This resulted in
                                    what I see as two use cases: a 30 second visit and a 5 minute
                                    visit (or longer).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe home page was designed to meet the
                                    requirements of a 30 second visit. My thought process was to place
                                    myself into the shoes of a reviewer who has a lot on their plate
                                    and has a short amount of time to give me, similar to a resume
                                    review process. As a result, I decided to only show a brief
                                    introduction about myself and my most recent projects on the home
                                    page. This shows the reviewer everything they would need to know
                                    in 30 seconds - who I am, and what I have done.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe rest of the site was designed to be
                                    used during longer visits. It shows my work history and skill set
                                    (resume), more details on every project I have finished, and some
                                    more detailed information about myself. Each of these pages would
                                    be available if the reviewer wanted to know more about me, but
                                    would not be absolutely necessary.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOverall, I think I accomplished my
                                    original goal, and I learned a lot in the process as well. I
                                    learned how to develop a github pages site, with the added bonus
                                    of learning how to use git to manage project check-ins. I improved
                                    on my web design skills, and overcame odd challenges such as
                                    having a form submission on a static website with no backend (I
                                    ended up using a Google form and submitting the form on my site to
                                    that). I believe this site represents me very well as of the time
                                    of completion and I look forward to being able to continue to
                                    improve myself as I finish more projects in the future.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn early spring 2018, myself and one other
                                    developer were tasked with redesigning the CWS website. During this
                                    redesign process I was responsible for developing the co-ops page,
                                    which shows potential co-op students the information they would
                                    need to know if they were to co-op at CWS, as well as a few
                                    components on the home page before handing those off to another
                                    developer.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur goal for the co-ops page was to
                                    display all important information cleanly and update our web
                                    design to 2018 standards. In addition to this, I was responsible
                                    for creating this page from scratch, including the overall design
                                    and layout of the page. This was a challenge for me at the time
                                    due to having no prior resources to get me started. It was also
                                    the first website I had made using Bootstrap 4 so I had to learn
                                    it as I went as well.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In the end, I was able to develop a layout that looked pretty good
                                    and accomplished all of our goals. It utilized flexbox and the
                                    more full-screen/large font design practices of 2018 and taught me
                                    a lot about developing for the UX instead of just focusing on UI
                                    like I had in previous projects. Also, there were quite a few
                                    components I was very fond of, which is why you may notice some
                                    similarities between my portfolio site and this page.

                                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspResearch Map was designed to allow staff 
                                    members at Auburn University to create flow chart style research 
                                    maps to show research progress at Auburn University. For this 
                                    project, I was responsible for leading two other developers during 
                                    my third co-op and our team was the first in CWS history to 
                                    complete two projects in one semester, with AUFSTC being the first.

                                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis project had its own unique set of 
                                    challenges to overcome, such as random issues caused by Draw2D.js 
                                    which we used for the editor portion of the site. My personal 
                                    development responsibilities for this site included the entire 
                                    sites UI/UX design/development, the project creations, and Draw2D 
                                    bugs as they arrived.

                                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAUFSTC (Auburn University Football 
                                    Student Ticketing Center) is by far the biggest and most 
                                    high profile project I have ever created. It was designed to
                                    replace the old ticketing system the student body used to manage
                                    their football ticket purchases after SGA enacted new rules for
                                    football tickets prior to the 2017 season. AUFSTC allows all Auburn
                                    students to return their tickets to a central pool where other
                                    students may request from, manage their guest ticket purchases,
                                    manage any penalties that may occur, and appeal those penalties if
                                    they so desire.
                                </p>

                                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor this project, I was responsible
                                    for leading a team of myself and two other developers to create
                                    this project in a month and a half to ensure it would be ready
                                    for football season. My role as lead developer included ensuring
                                    the project was staying on schedule and presenting project updates
                                    before SGA and Auburn Athletics. My individual developer roles 
                                    consisted of developing the entire site's UI/UX and included some
                                    backend work for form submissions throughout the site.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfter completion, the project was featured
                                    on the Auburn local televison station as well as in the campus paper.
                                    In the 2018 season alone, the ticket request page received over 
                                    32,000 hits and more than 1,600 penalty point appeals were made.
                                    This project was the biggest in my company's history at the time
                                    and is what I consider my greatest web achievement to date due to the
                                    high usage it receives and because of how important it is to the student
                                    body here at Auburn.

                                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWE Immunize was the second project that 
                                    I worked on during my first co-op term at CWS. It was also the 
                                    very first site I ever designed on my own with no existing 
                                    resources. WE Immunize was designed to allow pharmacies in 
                                    Alabama and California to enroll and then learn better
                                    immunization practices.

                                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspInitially, I designed an entire custom
                                    login page for this website to allow the client to host their
                                    own form submissions which was later deleted because they 
                                    preferred to use an existing third party form they had already
                                    created instead. However, this challenge provided me the opportunity
                                    to learn how to store passwords securely and how to design
                                    a lot of items from scratch due to the client not being affiliated
                                    with Auburn University, such as the login portal.

                                    during the 2016 elections. It came complete with an admin backend
                                    which allowed the president or CWS team to email all supporters
                                    status updates after completing the form on the home page.
